# Contributing to VSCode Up

Welcome, and thank you for considering contributing to VSCode Up. We encourage 
you to help out by raising issues, improving documentation, fixing bugs, or 
adding new features

If you're interested in contributing please start by reading this document. If 
you have any questions at all, or don't know where to start, please reach out 
to us on [Slack]. Please also take a look at our [code of conduct], which 
details how contributors are expected to conduct themselves as part of the 
Crossplane community.

## Contributing Code
To contribute bug fixes or features to vscode-up:

1. Communicate your intent.
1. Make your changes.
1. Test your changes.
1. Update documentation and examples where appropriate.
1. Open a Pull Request (PR).

Communicating your intent lets the Upbound maintainers know that you intend
to contribute, and how. This sets you up for success - you can avoid duplicating
an effort that may already be underway, adding a feature that may be rejected,
or heading down a path that you would be steered away from at review time. The
best way to communicate your intent is via a detailed GitHub issue. Take a look
first to see if there's already an issue relating to the thing you'd like to
contribute. If there isn't, please raise a new one! Let us know what you'd like
to work on, and why. The Upbound maintainers can't always triage new issues
immediately, but we encourage you to bring them to our attention via [Slack].

Be sure to practice [good git commit hygiene] as you make your changes. All but
the smallest changes should be broken up into a few commits that tell a story.
Use your git commits to provide context for the folks who will review PR, and
the folks who will be spelunking the codebase in the months and years to come.
Ensure each of your commits is signed-off in compliance with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin] by using `git commit -s`. Run `make reviewable` to lint 
your change.

Once your change is written, tested, and documented the final step is to have it
reviewed! You'll be presented with a template and a small checklist when you
open a PR. Please read the template and fill out the checklist. Please make all
requested changes in subsequent commits. This allows your reviewers to see what
has changed as you address their comments. Be mindful of  your commit history as
you do this - avoid commit messages like "Address review feedback" if possible.
If doing so is difficult a good alternative is to rewrite your commit history to
clean them up after your PR is approved but before it is merged.

In summary, please:

* Discuss your change in a GitHub issue before you start.
* Use your Git commit messages to communicate your intent to your reviewers.
* Sign-off on all Git commits by running `git commit -s`
* Add or update tests for all changes.
* Update all relevant documentation.
* Don't force push to address review feedback. Your commits should tell a story.
* If necessary, tidy up your git commit history once your PR is approved.

Thank you for reading through our contributing guide! We appreciate you taking
the time to ensure your contributions are high quality and easy for our
community to review and accept. Please don't hesitate to [reach out to
us][Slack] if you have any questions about contributing!
